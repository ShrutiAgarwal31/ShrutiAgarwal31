Hi, I’m Shruti Agarwal. I am a final year undergrad, pursuing Computer Science Enginnering from Symbiosis Institute of Technology, Pune. I’m interested in analyzing and observing humongous data. I try to provide some useful insights from the data. I’m currently learning NodeJS and planning to expand my domain horizon.
